\section*{Perspectives}

After identifying motifs should relate presence/absence of motifs to duplicated genes fate.

Motifs detection should take phylogeny into account for comparative analysis. Not the same value.

Need to improve pipeline for degenerate motifs, for the moment, extract only exact motif in the genome. (Ref. needed)

Need to measure diversity among detected motifs -> clustering tools and suppress rendundancy

Implement other motif finding tools to validate results.
